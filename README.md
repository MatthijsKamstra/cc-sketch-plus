# CC-Sketch-Plus

Proof of concept to sketch in canvas and svg in one library.

[CC-Sketch](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/cc-sketch) is a creative coding library written in Javascript via [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org).
This project started when I did a [30-days-challenge](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/creative-coding) and I decided it should be open-source.
